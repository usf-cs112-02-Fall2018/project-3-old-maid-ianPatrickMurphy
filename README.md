# OldMaidGame

Start game by running the OldMaid.java file.

Notes:
	This was most definitely the most difficult project so far. 
	I found inheritance to be mostly a minor annoyance while I 
	attempted to tackle the larger challenge: managing all the 
	data. I also struggled to create the game itself simply because 
	I had never played the game Old Maid and the instructions 
	seemed odd. For example, if each player's hand is shuffled 
	before every round of picking cards, then why give the players 
	the choice of what card they pick? Why not just randomize the 
	card they pick? That would make the game a lot smoother and 
	require a lot less unnecessary input from the user(s).
